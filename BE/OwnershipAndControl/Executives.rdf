It sets out the rights and duties of directors and stockholders individually and in meetings. Certain statutory clauses (such as those dealing with allotment, transfer, and forfeiture of shares) must be included; the other clauses are chosen by the stockholders to make up the bylaws of the organization. A court, however, may declare a clause ultra vires if it is deemed unfair, unlawful, or unreasonable. A copy of the articles is lodged with the appropriate authority such as the registrar of companies. Articles are public documents and may be inspected by anyone (usually on payment of a fee) either at the premises of the organization or at the registrar&apos;s office. Lenders to the organization take special interest in its provisions that impose a ceiling on the borrowings beyond which the organization&apos;s management must get shareholders&apos; approval before taking on more debt. The usual American term is articles of incorporation.</skos:definition>

Its members (directors) are elected normally by the subscribers (stockholders) of the firm (generally at an annual general meeting or AGM) to govern the firm and look after the subscribers&apos; interests. The board has the ultimate decision-making authority and, in general, is empowered to (1) set the company&apos;s policy, objectives, and overall direction, (2) adopt bylaws, (3) name members of the advisory, executive, finance, and other committees, (4) hire, monitor, evaluate, and fire the managing director and senior executives, (5) determine and pay the dividend, and (6) issue additional shares. Though all its members might not be engaged in the company&apos;s day-to-day operations, the entire board is held liable (under the doctrine of collective responsibility) for the consequences of the firm&apos;s policies, actions, and failures to act. Members of the board usually include senior-most executives (called inside directors or executive directors) as well as experts or respected persons chosen from the wider community (called outside directors or non-executive directors).</skos:definition>
