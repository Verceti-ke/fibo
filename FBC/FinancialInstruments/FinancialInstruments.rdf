		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">In the U.S., the Supreme Court has adopted a flexible and liberal approach in determining what constitutes a security. In its famous decision of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 90 L.Ed. 1244, 66 S.Ct. 1100 (1946), the Court held that land sales contracts for citrus groves in Florida, coupled with warranty deeds for the land and a contract to service the land, were &apos;investment contracts&apos; and thus securities. The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103. According to the Court, it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. 66 S.Ct. at 1104.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
