This is not the same as a model of a cashflow which is a consequence of applying some legal term for payment of interest or principal, but is a commitment expressed in purely cashflow terms. Review this though. Payout terms include: Values - values can only go up or down; Static values are defined for limits and the like. i.e. Constraints (and direction) - this covers caps and floors - these are read upward or downward Conditionality Formula relations (Input and Output): - these are values - these may have a cap or a floor on them also - these also may have Multiplication - there is also fixed margin - may have addition or substraction between these Linearity in covered in the above Timing / expiry Observaton (not terms): Probability Sensitivity</skos:editorialNote>

		<skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">The underlier breaks down into two separate meanings: The item which determines the value of the contract (the observable), and the item that is deliverable upon expiry or exercise of the contract (if there is one). These are usually the same item but in some cases such as index derivatives the exercise takes a different form. Action: Add &apos;Observable&apos; as a distinct term. Then use Deliverable. Is Underlier the union? In a Call Option the Underlier is the Deliverable and is referred to as the Underlier. With an Fx Call Option, the deliverable is the cash value which you are exchanging for the amount in another currency (so this is no difference as cash is instrument). Then take IR Swap where 3mo LIBOR Rate is the Observable, but the delivery is Cash. Then one would refer to the LIBOR as the Observable. Delivers an amount based on the observable, and the delivered cash is the Deliverable. So what we refer to as Underlier may be the Observable or the Deliverable e.g. Call option on IBM the deliverable is the IBM Stock whereas a Swap leg depending on LIBOR, the Deliverable is Cash but the &apos;Underlier&apos; is the Observable. Would be nore accurate not to refer to the Observable not as an Underlier. Therefore there would be nothing referred to as the &apos;Underlier&apos; as such. However, all derivatives have Underlier. Take an IR Cap, would not not refer to it as having an Underlier - the notion of Underlier becomes fuzzier when you get to higher order derivatives. LIBOR on a list of dates is an &apos;Observable&apos; but is several amounts.</skos:editorialNote>
