		<skos:changeNote xml:lang="en">The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20170201/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC to include additional properties and the linkage to LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote xml:lang="en">The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Relations/Relations.owl version of the ontology submitted with 
the FIBO FND RFC, was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
   (6) to move the ontology from the Utilities module to an independent Relations module
   (7) to revise a number of definitions, per discussion with various stakeholders.
   (8) to augment the definitions to include entity names from Business Entities.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote xml:lang="en">The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20130801/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was revised to add the appliesTo object property in support of the IND RFC.</skos:changeNote>
