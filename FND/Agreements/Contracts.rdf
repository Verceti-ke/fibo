		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Contracts Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract xml:lang="en">This ontology defines concepts relating to contracts, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include written contracts which are the concrete evidence of agreements between parties, along with verbal contracts. Contracts are further broken down into bilateral and transferable contracts, the latter being the basis for most financial instruments. Properties of contracts are also defined, in particular contractual terms and contract parties. These concepts all form the basis of concepts in the financial services industry, for example interest payment terms are a kind of contract terms set, and security holders are a kind of contract counterparty.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote xml:lang="en">The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Contracts.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.</skos:changeNote>

If the offeree acts on the offeror&apos;s promise, the offeror is legally obligated to fulfill the contract, but an offeree cannot be forced to act (or not act), because no return promise has been made to the offeror. After an offeree has performed, only one enforceable promise exists, that of the offeror.

A unilateral contract differs from a Bilateral Contract, in which the parties exchange mutual promises. Bilateral contracts are commonly used in business transactions; a sale of goods is a type of bilateral contract.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

ScopeNote: One thing to tease out is whether &apos;Dispute Resolution&apos; and other forms of &apos;Governing Law&apos; are one and the same thing or not. Dispute Resolution is uncontroversial, the question is whether there are other implications to Governing Law or if it&apos;s the same thing.

The details of the assignment determines some additional rights and liabilities (or duties).
